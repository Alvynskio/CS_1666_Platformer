## Bugs
1. Re-entry of Ceiling Portals
   * Reporter: Evan
   * When player movement is slow enough, when walking into a portal on a wall with the second on the ceiling, player will be teleported to the ceiling, and then BACK to the wall portal. This is an unwanted behavior.
   * Make player unable to teleport for a very small amount of time.  This cannot be too long, or a player might not be able to do a terminal velocity portal loop.
