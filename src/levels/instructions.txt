To create a level, just follow these simple instructions:

1. To make a portal surface:
    portalblock-{x position}-{y-position}-{width in tiles}-{height in tiles}

2. To make a non-portal surface:
    nonportalblock-{x position}-{y-position}-{width in tiles}-{height in tiles}

note: all tiles are 64x64 px, window is 1280 x 720 which equates to 20 x 11.25 tiles

3. To set a start point for your level:
    start-{x position}-{y-position}
