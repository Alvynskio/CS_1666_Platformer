To create a level, just follow these simple instructions:

1. To make a portal surface:
    portalblock-{x position}-{y position}-{width in tiles}-{height in tiles}

2. To make a non-portal surface:
    nonportalblock-{x position}-{y position}-{width in tiles}-{height in tiles}

3. To make a portal glass surface (you can shoot through but not walk through):
    nonportalblock-{x position}-{y position}-{width in tiles}-{height in tiles}

4. To make a pressure plate/gate combo:
    gateplate-{x position of plate}-{y position of plate}-{x position of gate}-{y position of gate}-{length of gate in PIXELS}-{0=horizontal, 1=vertical}

note: all tiles are 64x64 px, window is 1280 x 720 which equates to 20 x 11.25 tiles

3. To set a start point and block start point for your level:
    start-{x position}-{y-position}
